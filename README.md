# Samples
This depository contains 3 files:

English writing sample.pdf: The Introduction section of my Master thesis

coding sample 1.py: A Raondom Forest model for classifying transcriptional balance between RNA pairs.

coding sample 2.py: A Convolutional Neural Network coded with Keras for Kaggle competition.


My Master thesis involves a more representitive deep learning model but the script is stored in a restricted server for highly secured population data, so that it's difficult to download my script to the local computer.
